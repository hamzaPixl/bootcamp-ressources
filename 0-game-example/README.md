# Chicken Road Crossing Game

A delightful 2D game built with PixiJS where you control a chicken trying to cross busy roads while avoiding traffic.

## Game Rules

1. **Objective**: Cross the road as many times as possible without losing all your eggs.

2. **Gameplay**:

   - You control a white chicken with a red comb that needs to navigate through traffic.
   - Each time you get hit by a vehicle, you lose one egg.
   - You have 3 eggs (lives) to start with.
   - If you lose all your eggs, the game is over.

3. **Scoring**:

   - Each successful road crossing earns you 1 point.
   - The game gets progressively harder as your score increases.

4. **Environment**:
   - The game features alternating grass and road sections.
